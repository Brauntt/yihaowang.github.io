        <h1><em>About Me</em></h1>
        <p>
            I am currently a Software Engineer at Expedia Group, working on the search orchestration service which empoweres search engine for all Expedia brands. Prior to joining Expedia, I earned a Master’s degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University, where I was advised by <a href="https://www.davidlindlbauer.com/" target="_blank">Professor David Lindlbauer</a> and focused on <em><span style="color: #ff7700;">virtual reality</span></em>, <em><span style="color: #ff7700;">augmented reality</span></em>, and <em><span style="color: #ff7700;">deep learning</span></em>. I also hold a Master’s degree in Communications and Signal Processing from Imperial College London, where I worked closely with <a href="https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/christos-savvas.bouganis" target="_blank">Professor Christos-Savvas Bouganis</a> on image processing. Additionally, I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering through joint studies at the University of Birmingham and the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

        <h1><em>Research Interests</em></h1>
        <p>
            <span class="big-text">&ldquo;</span>
        <p>	I have a broad background in software engineering, electrical engineering, and machine learning. During my time at CMU, I had the opportunity to explore human-computer interaction in depth. After spending three years in the industry, I developed a strong interest in applying what I’ve learned to bridge the gap between technology and its users. While we have witnessed significant advancements in algorithms, applications, and devices, it remains essential to understand how these developments can meaningfully enhance individuals’ quality of life.</p>
        </p>
        <p>
            I am actively seeking Ph.D. opportunities in Human-Computer Interaction and Virtual Reality, beginning in <strong>Fall 2026</strong>.
