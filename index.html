        <h1><em>About Me</em></h1>
        <p>
            I am currently a Software Engineer at Expedia Group. Prior to joining Expedia, I earned a Master’s degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University, where I was advised by <a href="https://www.davidlindlbauer.com/" target="_blank">Professor David Lindlbauer</a> and focused on <em><span style="color: #ff7700;">virtual reality</span></em>, <em><span style="color: #ff7700;">augmented reality</span></em>, and <em><span style="color: #ff7700;">deep learning</span></em>. I also hold a Master’s degree in Communications and Signal Processing from Imperial College London, where I worked closely with <a href="https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/christos-savvas.bouganis" target="_blank">Professor Christos-Savvas Bouganis</a> on image processing. Additionally, I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering through joint studies at the University of Birmingham and the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Outside of work and research, I am passionate about traveling and <a href="https://unsplash.com/@brauntt" target="_blank">photography</a>. In my free time, I also enjoy running and playing badminton.

        <h1><em>Research Interests</em></h1>
        <p>
            <span class="big-text">&ldquo;</span>
        <p>I am fascinated by the interaction between humans and technology. With a broad background in software engineering, deep learning, and mixed reality, I have developed a growing curiosity about how algorithms drive improvements and how machines and humans interact in increasingly complex ways. I am particularly interested in studying how advancements in software and hardware can enhance user experiences in both the physical and digital worlds.</p>
        </p>
        <p>
            I am actively seeking Ph.D. opportunities in Human-Computer Interaction and Virtual Reality, beginning in <strong>Fall 2026</strong>.
